# `bbx_dsp`

This crate houses the foundational DSP code used for assembling complex chains of operations and functions.
It is intended to be used for easily prototyping and testing DSP algorithms for audio. 

## Setup

...

## Usage

It is incredibly easy to use the library. You just need to ...

```rust
fn todo() {
    todo!()
}
```

You can visit the [examples](https://github.com/blackboxdsp/bbx_audio/tree/develop/bbx_sandbox/examples/) to see more ways to interact with the library.

## Design

To understand the library, it is important to learn these key code components:

- The unit of data we are operating on is a `Sample`, which is typically a `f32` value
- A `Buffer` is a container for some number of `Sample`s
- A `Frame` is a container for some number of `Buffer`s, where each one pertains to an audio channel (e.g. mono is 1 buffer, stereo is 2 buffers)
- Each `Node` processes or generates a `Frame` during every audio callback
- A (DSP) `Graph` is an ordering of `Node`s that is evaluated during every audio callback
- A `Processor` traverses the graph and evaluates the `Frame` for each individual `Node`

A `Node` can be either a ...

- `Generator`
    - Generates a `Frame` containing a `Buffer` of audio `Sample`s for each channel
    - Reads from an arbitrary number of modulation input `Buffer`s each generated by a `Modulator` 
- `Effector`
    - Generates a `Frame` containing a `Buffer` of audio `Sample`s for each channel
    - Processes an arbitrary number of input `Frame`s generated by other `Node`s
    - Reads from an arbitrary number of modulation input `Buffer`s each generated by a `Modulator` 
- `Modulator`
    - Generates a `Buffer` of modulation data
    - Reads from an arbitrary number of modulation input `Buffer`s each generated by a `Modulator` 

A `Node` can contain multiple modulator inputs, however each input must correspond with only one modulator output.
