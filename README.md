## Getting Started

Setup is quite minimal except for a few required installations on Linux-based platforms.

:information_source: If you would like to use the `bbx_draw` crate for visualizations, follow the [instruction guide](https://guide.nannou.cc/getting_started/platform-specific_setup) to setup your environment for [Nannou](https://nannou.cc/).
Otherwise, continue on to the following steps.

### Linux

Install the following packages:
```bash
sudo apt install alsa libasound2-dev libssl-dev pkg-config
```

## Using the Sandbox

To run an example in the sandbox, use the following command:

```bash
# From the bbx_sandbox/ directory
cargo run --release --example <example_name>
```
